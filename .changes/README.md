# Changelog entries

Each file in this directory describes a change to be included
in then CHANGELOG.md.

A boilerplate file for new entries can be created using `make change-TYPE`
with `TYPE` being one of:

* changed
* added
* removed
* fixed

The resulting file should be edited to fill out the missing information.
